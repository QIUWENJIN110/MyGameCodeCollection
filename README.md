# MyGameCodeCollection
This repository contains three classic game projects developed as part of my application portfolio for postgraduate study in Computer Game Technology. The projects cover both Qt (C++) and Unity (C#) development, demonstrating core game development skills across different frameworks.

  - See [Game2048/README.md](Game2048/README.md) for details.

- **SnakeGame**: A classic snake game
  - See [SnakeGame/README.md](SnakeGame/README.md) for details.

  - See [BrickBreaker/README.md](BrickBreaker/README.md) for details.
