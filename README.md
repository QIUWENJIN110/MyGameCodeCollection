# MyGameCodeCollection
This repository contains three classic game projects developed as part of my application portfolio for postgraduate study in Computer Game Technology. The projects cover both Qt (C++) and Unity (C#) development, demonstrating core game development skills across different frameworks.

## Projects
- Game2048: Classic 2048 merge-the-tiles mini-game built with Qt (C++), featuring grid matrix logic, real-time UI update, tile merge algorithm, and score calculation system
  - See [Game2048/README.md](Game2048/README.md) for details.
- SnakeGame: A classic snake game developed with Qt (C++), integrating different spawn system, 2D collision detection, real-time game loop, snake movement path algorithm, and boundary collision handling
  - See [SnakeGame/README.md](SnakeGame/README.md) for details.
- BrickBreaker: A classic brick breaker game built with Unity (C#), integrating Unity Physics Engine, precise collision detection, UI , sphere angle offset algorithm, and multi-level progression system
  - See [BrickBreaker/README.md](BrickBreaker/README.md) for details.

## Build & Run
### For Qt Projects (Game2048 / SnakeGame)
1. Open the project `.pro` file in Qt Creator (Qt 5.14.2 MSVC2017 64-bit).
2. Configure and build for your target platform (Windows 10/11 64-bit recommended).
3. Run the application directly (no additional Qt environment required for pre-built releases).

### For Unity Project (BrickBreaker)
1. Open the project in Unity Editor 2022.3.x or later (macOS recommended).
2. The project folder "BrickBreaker" needs to be constructed using Unity
3. Build for macOS (64-bit) or run directly in the Unity Play Mode.
4. Pre-built macOS version is available in Releases (no Unity environment required).

## Pre-built Releases
All projects provide pre-built binaries for target platforms:
- Game2048: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- SnakeGame: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- BrickBreaker: macOS (64-bit)
- See [Releases](https://github.com/QIUWENJIN110/MyGameCodeCollection/releases) for download.
