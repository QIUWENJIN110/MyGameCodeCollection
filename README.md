# MyGameCodeCollection
This repository contains three classic game projects developed as part of my application portfolio for postgraduate study in Computer Game Technology. The projects cover both Qt (C++) and Unity (C#) development, demonstrating core game development skills across different frameworks.

## Projects
- **Game2048**: A C++/Qt 5.14.2 implementation of the 2048 puzzle game, focusing on grid logic, UI rendering, and cross-platform input handling.
  - See [Game2048/README.md](Game2048/README.md) for details.

- **SnakeGame**: A classic snake game built with Qt 5.14.2 (C++), demonstrating 2D rendering, game loop design, collision detection, and real-time input response.
  - See [SnakeGame/README.md](SnakeGame/README.md) for details.

- **BrickBreaker**: A classic brick-breaking game developed with Unity (C#) for macOS platform, featuring physics-based collision, level progression, audio feedback, and Mac-specific input adaptation (keyboard/trackpad support).
  - See [BrickBreaker/README.md](BrickBreaker/README.md) for details.

## Build & Run
### For Qt Projects (Game2048 / SnakeGame)
1. Open the project `.pro` file in Qt Creator (Qt 5.14.2 or later).
2. Configure and build for your target platform (Windows 10/11 64-bit recommended).
3. Run the application directly (no additional Qt environment required for pre-built releases).

### For Unity Project (BrickBreaker)
1. Open the project in Unity Editor 2022.3.x or later (macOS recommended).
2. Navigate to `Assets/Scenes/BrickBreaker.unity` to open the main game scene.
3. Build for macOS (64-bit) or run directly in the Unity Play Mode.
4. Pre-built macOS version is available in Releases (no Unity environment required).

## Pre-built Releases
All projects provide pre-built binaries for target platforms:
- Game2048: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- SnakeGame: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- BrickBreaker: macOS (64-bit)
